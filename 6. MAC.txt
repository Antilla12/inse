6. To configure and understand Mandatory Access Control (MAC) mechanisms in a Linux environment.


SELinux won't work. ~ You would need a full Linux VM (like Fedora, CentOS, or RHEL) or a real Linux machine
Requirement ~ Linux VM or Linux Machine


1. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
Create Files and Directories:
mkdir mac_demo && cd mac_demo
touch confidential.txt


a) Enable SELinux:
getenforce
If SELinux is not enabled:
sudo setenforce 1


b) Apply Security Context to a File: (Create A file name : confidential.txt)
ls -Z confidential.txt


c) Test Policy Enforcement:
Try accessing the file through an unauthorized process.
sudo cat /var/log/audit/audit.log


d) Results:
SELinux denies access to unauthorized processes and logs the event in audit.log.
Unauthorized processes will be denied access, even if they are run by the file owner.
