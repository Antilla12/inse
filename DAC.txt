5. To configure and understand Discretionary Access Control (DAC mechanisms in a Linux environment.


1. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
a) Create Files and Directories:
mkdir dac_demo && cd dac_demo
touch confidential.txt


b) Set Permissions Using chmod:
chmod 600 confidential.txt
(for WSL) ~ sudo chmod o-rx /home/username/dac_demo


c) Change File Ownership Using chown
sudo adduser alice
sudo chown alice:alice confidential.txt


d) Log in as Alice:
su alice
cat confidential.txt
(if su doesn’t work on WSL) (FOR WSL)
sudo -i -u alice
sudo su - alice
ls /home/atharv/dac_demo ~ Output :
ls: cannot access '/home/username/dac_demo': Permission denied


e) Results:
* Alice, as the file owner, can access confidential.txt
* Other users (e.g., the default user) cannot read or write to the file because of the restrictive permissions (600).
