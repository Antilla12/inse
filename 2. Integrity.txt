2. To explore the Integrity identify potential security violations through practical examples and system analysis.


1. Create or Access a Log File
* Use an existing log file or create a simulated one:
Linux: sudo nano /var/log/syslog (requires root access).
Windows: Open Event Viewer (eventvwr) or create a text file named logfile.txt


2. Modify the Log File (Simulate Unauthorized Changes)
* Add or change log entries to simulate a security violation:
Linux: Edit the file: sudo nano /var/log/syslog → Add a fake entry: Jan 1 12:00:00 UnauthorizedAccess: Admin login
Windows: Open logfile.txt in Notepad and add UnauthorizedAccess: Admin login.


3. Verify Integrity with Hashing
* Calculate the file's hash before and after modification
Linux: Use sha256sum logfile.txt and note the hash
Windows: Use PowerShell: Get-FileHash .\logfile.txt -Algorithm SHA256
* Observe the hash difference.
