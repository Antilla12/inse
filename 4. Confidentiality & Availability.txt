4. To explore the Confidentiality and Availability and identify potential security violations through practical examples and system analysis.


1. Create a File Containing Sensitive Information
* Open a terminal or command prompt.
* Create a text file named sensitive_file.txt:
Linux: echo "Confidential Data: Usernames and Passwords" > sensitive_file.txt
Windows: Open Notepad, type "Confidential Data: Usernames and Passwords", and save the file as sensitive_file.txt.


2. Restrict File Permissions
* Set file permissions so only the owner can access it:
Linux: Run chmod 600 sensitive_file.txt
Windows: Right-click the file → Properties → Security → Edit permissions → Deny access for all users except the owner.


3. Simulate Unauthorized Access
* Switch to another user or simulate unauthorized access:
Linux: Use su or create a new user, then try accessing the file:cat sensitive_file.txt
Windows: Switch user accounts or create a new user, then try opening the file.
* Observe the error message (e.g., "Permission denied").
—
1. Set Up a Simple Web Server (Optional)
Linux: Use Python to start a basic web server: python3 -m http.server 8080
Windows: Use IIS or WAMP/XAMPP to set up a local server.


2. Simulate Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack
* Use a tool to overload the server with requests:
Linux: Install and use ab (Apache Benchmark):
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:8080/
[-n: Total number of requests, -c: Number of concurrent requests.]
Windows: Use a custom PowerShell script or any load-testing tool like JMeter


3. Monitor Server Behavior
* Observe the server response time during the attack:
Linux: Check server logs or terminal output for delays or errors.
Windows: Use Task Manager or Resource Monitor to track CPU and network usage.
* Note any timeouts or connection refusals.


4. Restore Normal Operations
* Stop the attack and ensure normal availability:
Linux: Terminate the ab command or server process (Ctrl+C)
Windows: Stop the server or restart it via IIS Manager.
* Verify that the server is responsive again.
